# howOldWereYou
Show how old one was on various historical dates

This is a web site that accepts someone's name and birthday as input, then shows a table
listing how old that person was at various dates in history. When the user clicks on "Show 
Table", the content of the "bday" field is checked to see if Javascript will accept it as
a date. If not, an error message is shown. If so, the table is generated.
